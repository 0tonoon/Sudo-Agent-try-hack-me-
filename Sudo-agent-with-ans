#Q1 How many open ports?

'''
Ans :- 3
'''

#Q2 How you redirect yourself to a secret page?
The web page says that you have to get to the secret page with a code name as user
that means we can change the value of the user agent to get access to the page 

'''
Ans :- user-agent 
'''


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



#Q3 What is the agent name?

if request were made with changing user agent values then you can get mulitple responses i tried switching the user agent to R with curl you can do it with burp 
too, got this response

# Task 3 

Q1 FTP password
so accoring to taks 2 chris has a week  password so we can brute force it with hydra, I used hydra with rockyou and got this

#Q2 Zip file password

After login as christ in FTP i got some files i downloaded them and one of the text file said this

All these alien like photos are fake! Agent R stored the real picture inside your directory. Your login password is somehow stored in the fake picture. It shouldn't be a problem for you.

The rest files where png and a jpg file so i used steghide but it demanded for a passphrase so decidec to use john on those files 
john gave me this

which was a useless approach by me 

The Question says that there is a zip file so i tried using Binwalk which did extracted the cuite.png file but not the other image file 
this is what i got from binwalk

The extracted folder conatained a zip file and teh above reponse says that the zip file 8072.zip was encrypted so we can use Zip2john to get the hash to a hash file
